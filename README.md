## Overview
The **COVID-19 Analysis** project showcases interactive Power BI dashboards that provide valuable insights on the COVID-19 pandemic based on case data from **January 2020** to **July 2020** .
<br>
<br>

## Data Sources
The data used in this project is sourced from the Kaggle dataset [COVID-19 Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/imdevskp/corona-virus-report).
> [!NOTE]
> files **fully_grouped.csv** and population dataset derived from **worldmeter_data.csv** were only used in this analysis..

## Reports - Power BI
The ![COVID-19.pbix](https://github.com/abhi-ram-krishna/COVID-19-Analysis-Power_BI/blob/cc626aa0f64fac71c3a1ad909940e642de99ab97/COVID-19.pbix) file includes a report containing five pages: Overview, Map, Top-N, Highlights, and Scatter Plot.

- **The Overview Page**: this page prominently displays essential metrics such as total confirmed cases, total deaths, total recovered, active cases, recovery rate etc. Doughnut charts exhibiting the distribution of confirmed cases, deaths, and recovered cases by WHO regions are included.

- **The Map Page**: as the name suggests this page contains Map based matrices.

- **The Top-N Page**: this page exhibit details of countries topped the list by number active cases, deaths, recovery, cumilative cases etc.

- **The Highlights Page**: this page exhibit details of countries topped with lowest active cases and deaths.

- **The Scatter Plot Page**: contains scatter plot that shows the relation between population and number of confirmed cases by both country and WHO region.

Images of all the other sheets in the report are given in ![COVID-19.pdf](https://github.com/abhi-ram-krishna/COVID-19-Analysis-Power_BI/blob/cc626aa0f64fac71c3a1ad909940e642de99ab97/COVID-19.pdf).

## Insights
> [!IMPORTANT]
> All the insights provided are based on case data from January 2020 to July 2020. Other variants and waves of COVID-19 were observed later, and recovery rates improved with research and vaccination efforts initiated after July 2020.

The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic is a global outbreak of coronavirus â€“ an infectious disease caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2).
Cases of novel coronavirus (nCoV) were first detected in China in December 2019, with the virus spreading rapidly to other countries across the world.

- The global trend of COVID-19 cases showed a steady rise after February 2020, when cases were reported outside China and the WHO declared the outbreak a Public Health Emergency of International Concern.

- A steep increase occurred after March 2020, when the cumulative number of cases began doubling within days, leading the WHO to declare COVID-19 a pandemic.

- The global trend of COVID-19 exhibited multiple peaks, with waves of infection spreading from May to July 2020, resulting in a significant rise in confirmed cases. Amidst this surge, the number of recovered cases also peaked, while the death rate remained relatively stable due to travel restrictions, hotspot-based quarantine measures, and other preventive actions.

- Initially, the outbreak predominantly affected countries in the Western Pacific Region, such as China, Taiwan, and Vietnam. However, after March 2020, countries in the European region, followed by the Americas, became the epicenters of the infection.

- This shift was due to the fact that countries in the Western Pacific Region and the South-East Asian Region implemented a combination of strategies, including full lockdowns, aggressive test-and-trace programs, mask mandates, and digital contact tracing. In contrast, many other countries were slower to respond, disregarded scientific advice, or faced challenges in managing the outbreak effectively.( [reference](https://www.nature.com/immersive/d41586-020-03437-4/index.html) )

- Countries in the Americas (e.g., the US, Brazil), the European region (e.g., Russia, Spain, Italy), and India (in the SEAR region) reported the highest number of confirmed cases, with the US leading overall. A similar trend was observed in the number of deaths, though India had a lower death count compared to its number of confirmed cases, with a higher number of recoveries.

- Countries in the African region, as well as certain islands, including some in the Americas, had the lowest number of confirmed cases and deaths due to their relative isolation from other countries and regions.

- After reviewing additional references, it was found that population size or population density in WHO regions and respective countries was not the sole reason for the widespread infection, although it did hinder efforts to control infections in countries like China, Japan, India, and the USA.
